You have found the astralbrowser demo site.

There are 50,000 plausible sounding fake files in this index. Search for
something to see how fast it is!

The search occurs in real-time as the index downloads. Subsequent searches
(usually after a few keypresses) are more-or-less instantaneous at 18ms or so.

You can also browse the fake file hierarchy -- nginx autoindex is simulated.
Use a mouse, or arrow keys and Enter.

See https://github.com/naggie/astralbrowser for more information.
